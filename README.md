## This app will allow you to search for breweries in a selected location.
### It uses the BreweryDB API to help narrow the search to breweries of a certain size (brewpub, micro, regional, naitonal)
### The Guoogle API is then used to get the location coordinates and additional information, and put them on the map.
### A list of the breweries and basic information about them will be displayed.  It will be separated by whether they're currently open.

## Features/technology
### The app limits the search location to the united states.
### It uses the Google autocomplete address web service to assist in selecting and validating the location.
### It uses the Bulma css framework to pretty-fy the display and to make it mobile responsive.
### It uses a modal dialog to communicate information to the user.
